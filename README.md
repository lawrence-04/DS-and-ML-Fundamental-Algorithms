# DS and ML Fundamental Algorithms
This repository is a collection of fundamental algorithms across data science and machine learning. The goal of this repository is to act as a learning resource, as well as to strengthen my own understanding of various algorithms. The goal is *not* to create a rigorous and robust implementation that should be used in production.

For each algorithm, I use libraries that allow me to demonstrate the core methodology, without having to write large amounts of unrelated code.

Each algorithm comes with an example usecase and basic tests.
